# Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project focuses on predicting customer attrition for a telecommunications company. It demonstrates the full data science workflow, from complex data cleaning to handling highly imbalanced datasets using advanced sampling techniques.

🚀 Key Features

End-to-End ANN Implementation: Built using TensorFlow/Keras.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Implemented SMOTE, Under-sampling, Over-sampling, and Ensemble methods to improve model recall and F1-score.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned 7,000+ records, handled missing values, and performed One-Hot Encoding and Min-Max Scaling.

Evaluation: Detailed analysis using Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

📈 Results

The model successfully identifies potential churners by balancing precision and recall, significantly outperforming a baseline model that doesn't account for class imbalance.

Developed as part of my AIML portfolio.
